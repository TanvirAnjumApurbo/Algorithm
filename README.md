  <h1>üß† Algorithm Repository üìä</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Algorithm repository! This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in both C and Java programming languages. Whether you're a student learning about these algorithms or a developer looking for reference implementations, you'll find useful code snippets here.</p>

## üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms Included

1. **Selection Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.
2. **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
3. **Quick Sort**: Another divide and conquer algorithm that picks an element as pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
4. **Insertion Sort**: A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position.
5. **0/1 Knapsack**: A dynamic programming algorithm for solving the 0/1 knapsack problem, where items have a weight and a value and we need to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting some of the items without exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.
6. **Fractional Knapsack**: An algorithm for solving the fractional knapsack problem, where items have a weight and a value, and we can take fractions of items to maximize the total value.
7. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: An algorithm to find the longest subsequence present in given sequences in order, with the same relative order in both the sequences but not necessarily contiguous.

## üåê Languages Used

- **C**: High-level programming language commonly used for system programming.
- **Java**: Object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence and robustness.

## üîç How to Use

Each algorithm is implemented in separate files under their respective language directories (`C` and `Java`). You can navigate to the specific algorithm directory to find the code implementation along with a brief explanation of the algorithm's logic.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with it, and use it in your projects as needed!
